# Pomodoro App

An application for applying the pomodoro technique.

This is a personal project with the aim of learning flutter and multiplatform development even though it is mainly focused on androd devices right now, but with future eyes on exporting it to other platforms.

The main goal is to have an application with different styles. Right now the main theme is retrowave/retrofuturism but I have in mind to implement other themes such as steampunk and nature.

For the first theme I got inspired by [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14601636-retrowave) by [Ilya Shapko](https://dribbble.com/Shapko), obtained from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com)
